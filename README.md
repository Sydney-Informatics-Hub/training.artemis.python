# Artemis Training Series

This is the overview page for the Artemis training course series. The individual lessons are listed below:

| Lesson Repo    | Overview |
| ------- | ---------- |
| [Introduction to Artemis HPC](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/training.artemis.introhpc) | Introduces USyd's High Performance Computer (HPC), ‘Artemis’. We cover connecting and navigating Artemis, available software, and how to submit and monitor jobs using the PBS Pro scheduler.|
| [Introduction to the Research Data Store and Data Transfer](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/training.artemis.rds) |  Learn how to transfer data between your local computer, external sources, the University's Research Data Store (RDS) and Artemis HPC. |
|[Intermediate Artemis HPC](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/training.artemis.interhpc) | Learn how to automate multiple-run analyses with job arrays and do simple bash scripting on Artemis. The live training consists of two hours of instruction and practical exercises. |
|[Parallel Python](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/training.artemis.python) | Learn some simple and effective tools and logic to make your Python code faster, then just use brute force to run it on a HPC cluster. |
|[Matlab on Artemis: The MDCS](https://informatics.sydney.edu.au/training/coursedocs/MDCS_MatlabTraining.pdf) | Artemis HPC hosts a Matlab Distributed Computing Server (MDCS) - this allows users to submit MATLAB jobs directly to Artemis from within their local Matlab instance on their machines. Come and learn how to use this service. |
