This episode shows you a few of the basic tools that we can use in Python to make our code go faster.

# Loops, Iterators, and Genorators

# Vectorising code with numpy and pandas

# Multi-threading/processing 

# MPI: Message Passing Interface
MPI is a standardized and portable message-passing system designed to function on a wide variety of parallel computers.
The standard defines the syntax and semantics of a core of library routines useful to a wide range of users writing portable message-passing programs in C, C++, and Fortran. There are several well-tested and efficient implementations of MPI, many of which are open-source or in the public domain.

**MPI for Python**
mpi4py provides bindings of the MPI standard for the Python programming language, allowing any Python program to exploit multiple processors.
