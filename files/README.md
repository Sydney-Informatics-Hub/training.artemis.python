# hpc
training material and tools for HPC use
Under development and the moment.

Main goal: develop working examples that assist hpc use with python,
using modern libraries and techniques

1. Using simple functions (calculation of pi) in parallel manner using python multiprocessing
2. Intermediate scaling (mpi4py, threads, numba 
3. Working with large data and functions
4. Simulation and Visualisation cases (pangeo, dask etc)
