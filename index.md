**Synopsis:** This course is aimed at researchers who currently want to accelerate their Python codes.

**Target audience:** Users of HPC, novice to intermediate Python users who want to explore multiprocessing in Python primarly for use on parallel architecture.

**Follow-on courses:** This course is part of the **[Artemis HPC Training Series]({{ site.series_home }})**. A lot of these examples come from https://github.com/csc-training/hpc-python and https://support.pawsey.org.au/documentation/display/US/Training+Material, see these sites for more in-depth courses on all sorts of cool stuff.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> You must have competency on the Unix/Linux command line. If you are interested in learning HPC but have no Unix/Linux command-line skills, you MUST first take an [Introduction to Unix/Linux](https://intersect.org.au/training/course/unix) course, followed by [‘_Introduction to Artemis HPC_’]({{ site.sih_pages }}/training.artemis.interhpc).
>
>You should be able to read and write basic Python scripts.
>
> You are assumed to have your own Artemis account, know how to connect to Artemis, navigate its filesystem, and submit jobs to the PBS Scheduler. If you are not familiar with HPC, you should take [‘_Introduction to Artemis HPC_’]({{ site.sih_pages }}/training.artemis.interhpc) before attempting this course. This will teach you the basic requirements around HPC environments.
