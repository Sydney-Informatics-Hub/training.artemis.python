# 1. Get a Python client
We generally use and recommend Miniconda Python distribution: [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). But feel free to use whatever one works for you.
You can do all the exercises on Artemis for the training session, but in the real worl it is best to do offline development so we recommend getting Python working.

<br>

## 2. Python environemnt
To run all the commands today in your own Python installation, you can set up an environemnt with something like this:

~~~
conda create -n advpy dask==2.11.0 distributed==2.11.0 netCDF4==1.5.3 numpy==1.18.1 pandas==1.0.1 scipy==1.4.1 xarray==0.15.0 mpi4py==3.0.3 -c conda-forge
~~~

Or install driectly from the [yaml environment file](/files/environment_python.yml) with:
~~~
conda env create -f environment_python.yml
~~~

Activate the environemnt with:
~~~
conda activate advpy
~~~

<br>

# 3. Get access to the HPC
Visit [https://dashr.sydney.edu.au/](https://dashr.sydney.edu.au/) and make a project, be sure to request Artemis HPC access for the project.
Otherwise the ideas and methods we will present today are transferable to national HPC infastructure like NCI or Pawsey or even any  cloud providor.

<br>

# 4. Get a shell terminal emulator

To connect to Artemis HPC, and follow this lesson, you will need a **'terminal emulator'** program installed on your computer. Often just called a 'terminal', or 'shell terminal', 'shell client', terminal emulators give you a window with a _command line interface_ through which you can send commands to be executed by your computer.

## A. Linux systems

If you use Linux, then chances are you already know your shell and how to use it. Basically, just open your preferred terminal program and off you go! An X-Window server (X11) may also be useful if you want to be able to use GUIs; again, if you're using Linux you probably have one, and if you don't have one, it's probably because you intentionally disabled it!

Connection to Artemis can be made via ssh by issuing the following command on the shell:
~~~
ssh -X <unikey>@hpc.sydney.edu.au
~~~

## B. OSX (Mac computers and laptops)

Mac operating systems come with a terminal program, called Terminal. Just look for it in your Applications folder, or hit Command-Space and type 'terminal'. You may find that other, 3rd party terminal programs are more user-friendly and powerful -- I use [Iterm2](https://www.iterm2.com/).

</figure><br>

We also recommend installing [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/), which will replace OSX's native X-Window server. XQuartz has some extra features that may offer better performance when using GUI programs. You'll need to log out and back in again after installing XQuartz in order for it to activate.

Connection to Artemis can be made via ssh by issuing following command on in the terminal:
~~~
ssh -X <unikey>@hpc.sydney.edu.au
~~~

## C. Windows

If you're using a Windows machine, don't panic! You might not have used 'CMD' since Windows 95 but, rest assured, Windows still has a couple of terminal programs and shells buried in the Programs menu.

However, those aren't going to work for us, as you'll need extra programs and utilities to connect to Artemis, such as an _SSH_ implementation. To use Artemis on Windows, you have a couple of options:

### i. PuTTY (Recommended)

PuTTY, an SSH and telnet client, is another good simple option. However, note that PuTTY **does not** provide an X11 server, so you won't be able to use GUI programs on Artemis with _just_ PuTTY.

Head to [https://putty.org](https://putty.org) and download PuTTY. You can install it to your computer, or just download the 'binary' and run it directly. Create a new session for use with Artemis as follows:

1. Fill in the connection details:
  - Host Name: **hpc.sydney.edu.au**
  - Port: **22**
  - Connection type: **SSH**   

   <img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/s_putty.png" style="margin:10px;height:400px" >
2. Name this session **"Artemis"** and click 'Save'

### ii. X-Win32

[X-Win32](https://www.starnet.com/xwin32/) is full-featured X-server and terminal emulator for Windows. USyd [provides a license](http://staff.ask.sydney.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/316) for it; however, the download link is restricted to staff so, students. Install, and follow the instructions on the USyd-ICT page to activate -- you'll need to be on the USyd network or [VPN](http://staff.ask.sydney.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/519/kw/vpn) to do so.

### iii. WSL and Ubuntu

Install Ubuntu or some other Linux distro on the Windows Subsystem for Linux see [here for details](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview). This one will give you a full suite of Linux functions and I like it for emulating Linux.

# 5. Off-campus access

If you're attempting this training by yourself, or following on **[Zoom](https://uni-sydney.zoom.us/)**, _off-campus_ then you'll need to connect to the USyd internet network _before_ you can connect to Artemis.

There are a couple ways to do this:

## A. The USyd VPN

**VPN** (Virtual Private Network) is a protocol that allows you to tap into a local private network remotely. Follow USyd Service Now instructions [on the Cisco Any Connect VPN](https://sydneyuni.service-now.com/sm?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0011049&sys_kb_id=9e86e1a3dbdf0c50e35b89e4059619b9). Once you've connected to the VPN, the above connection methods will work, just as though you were on-campus.

## B. Use the Artemis Jump server

Artemis provides a 'gateway' server, called **Jump**, that allows connections from outside the University network, and is itself on the network. From the Jump server, you can then connect to Artemis directly. If using the Jump server, you will need to edit the **host address** used in the instructions above:

* Instead of **hpc.sydney.edu.au** _use_ **jump.research.sydney.edu.au**

This will connect you to Jump, rather than Artemis itself. You can then connect to Artemis directly via **SSH**. See [Episode 1 of the _Introduction to Artemis HPC_ course]({{ site.sih_pages }}/training.artemis.introhpc/01-intro).
